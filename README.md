# Student Management Web Application (PHP & PostgreSQL)

## Description
This is a simple web application for managing student records, built with PHP and PostgreSQL. Users can add new students through a web form, storing their details in a PostgreSQL database. The project demonstrates full-stack integration of front-end HTML forms with a back-end database using PHP.
