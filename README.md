# Student Management Web Application (PHP & PostgreSQL)

## Description
This is a simple web application for managing student records, built with PHP and PostgreSQL. The project allows users to add new students through a web form, storing their details in a PostgreSQL database. It demonstrates the integration of front-end forms with a back-end database using PHP.

## Features
- Add new student records with the following fields:
  - Name
  - Gender
  - Date of Birth
  - Email
- PostgreSQL handles automatic student ID generation (`codigoaluno`) with identity columns.
- Simple and clean HTML front-end interface.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP 8.x** for server-side scripting
- **PostgreSQL** as the database
- **HTML & CSS** for the front-end form
- Optional: **pgAdmin** for database management

## Getting Started

- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Web browser to access the form
